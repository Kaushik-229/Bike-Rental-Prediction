# Bike-Rental-Prediction
Seoul Bike Rental Prediction
This project analyzes the Seoul Bike Sharing Dataset to understand the relationship between environmental factors (temperature, humidity, rainfall, etc.) and bike rental demand. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), linear regression modeling, neural networks modeling, and visualization of predictions.

This also lets us understand how effective the environmental factors are individually by using Linear Regression model and Neural Network model, but also highlights the accuracy increase when multiple environmental factors are given to the model.

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, TensorFlow.
